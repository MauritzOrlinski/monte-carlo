# Monte Carlo Integration

> A Monte Carlo Visualizer

## What does it do?

This program approximates functions using the Monte Carlo Integration method. It also gives you a Visualization of the function and the randomly chosen points.
The Area approximation is given in the terminal.

## Setting other values

As I do not support argument parsing at the time, all values have to be set manually in main.c, this is a bit annoying so I will consider implementing a small argument parser and expression evaluator in the feature.
